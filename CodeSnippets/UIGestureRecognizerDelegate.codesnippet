#pragma mark - PROTOCOL UIGestureRecognizerDelegate 
#pragma mark - OPTIONAL methods for protocol UIGestureRecognizerDelegate 
// called when a gesture recognizer attempts to transition out of UIGestureRecognizerStatePossible. returning NO causes it to transition to UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed
// - (BOOL)gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer{ }

// called when the recognition of one of gestureRecognizer or otherGestureRecognizer would be blocked by the other
// return YES to allow both to recognize simultaneously. the default implementation returns NO (by default no two gestures can be recognized simultaneously)
//
// note: returning YES is guaranteed to allow simultaneous recognition. returning NO is not guaranteed to prevent simultaneous recognition, as the other gesture's delegate may return YES
// - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)otherGestureRecognizer{ }

// called once per attempt to recognize, so failure requirements can be determined lazily and may be set up between recognizers across view hierarchies
// return YES to set up a dynamic failure requirement between gestureRecognizer and otherGestureRecognizer
//
// note: returning YES is guaranteed to set up the failure requirement. returning NO does not guarantee that there will not be a failure requirement as the other gesture's counterpart delegate or subclass methods may return YES
// - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldRequireFailureOfGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)otherGestureRecognizer NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(7_0){ }
// - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldBeRequiredToFailByGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)otherGestureRecognizer NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(7_0){ }

// called before touchesBegan:withEvent: is called on the gesture recognizer for a new touch. return NO to prevent the gesture recognizer from seeing this touch
// - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldReceiveTouch:(UITouch *)touch{ }
